    "In this project we will identify the primary emotion expressed in a tweet. We will be using SMILE dataset for this task. The project will be tested using 2 methodologies. The first method used for this task is Rule-based method, the second method is ML based Random Forest and the thrid method is using DistilBERT Transformer.\n",

    "#### Random Forest: \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble ML model that uses multiple decision trees algorithm at the same time during training . For classification task, the ouput class chosen by majority of decision trees will be selected as the final output class for the random forest. We choose this model for testing because Random Forest gives comparatively accurate and faster results than other algorithms as it grows multiple decision trees for giving output. It also works well while using larger datasets and it is capable of maintaining accuracy even if a large proportion of dataset is missing.  \n",

    "#### DistilBERT Transformer:\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bi-Directional Encoder Representation Transformer) is a transformer model in NLP which calculates embeddings from the dataset that can be used for achieving various other NLP based tasks. **DistilBERT** is a derivative of BERT that reduces the model size upto 40% eventually giving faster results. Transformers are used in ML to reduce the training time as they enable simultaneous sequence processing through parallelization.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a dataset, let's work on developing some solutions for emotion classification. We'll start with implementing a simple rule-based classifier which will also serve as our naive baseline. Emotive language (e.g. awesome, feel great, super happy) can be a strong signal as to the overall emotion being by the tweet. For each emotion in our label space (happy, surprised, sad, angry) we will generate a set of words and phrases that are often associated with that emotion. At classification time, the classifier will calculate a score based on the overlap between the words in the tweet and the emotive words and phrases for each of the emotions. The emotion label with the highest overlap will be selected as the prediction and if there is no match the \"no-emotion\" label will be predicted. We can break the implementation of this rules-based classifier into three steps:\n",

Then we should ensure that the extracted terms for each emotion label do not appear in the other lists. In the real world, we would then manually curate the generated lists to ensure that associated words were useful and emotive."

    "I would recommend to use DistilBERT model among other as this model has given the highest accuracy score of all ranging to 0.82. The accuracy score obtained after Rules-based model were 0.79 where as accuracy score obtained after machine learning w/POS features were 0.76. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rule based models are a good choice for small, easy data. They execute really fast. But these models are specific to certain tasks and domain and might not perform better for other purposes. While they did give good accuracy but again it always depends upon datasets used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning models are not restricted to domains and they perform better when incorporated with labelled data by identifying relationships and patterns. If good data is provided and good pre-processing is carried out they can do very well. Also support POS tagging leading to better performace. Although, because they perform better on labelled data these models are not much flexible and pre-processing needs to be of top quality to obtain good results. Overfitting issues are very common in Machine Learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe DistilBERT to be the best choice to use especially when doing tasks such as opinion mining or emotion detection. DistilBERT model provides State Of The Art performance and can work well on unsupervised data as well. Although it takes a lot of time eventually making it expensive than other models. Also, to get optimal performance we need to provide huge number of data. It is also more complex than other 2 models. Requires more computational resources than other 2 models but still a good choice. Although for this dataset it only performed well in case of 'no-emotion' and 'happy' data unlike the other two models. But good pre-processing and good data quality can improve the results."
