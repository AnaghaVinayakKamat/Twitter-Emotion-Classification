# Twitter-Emotion-Classification


### Overview
This project focuses on classifying the emotions present in tweets using three distinct models:

1. **Rule-Based Model:** A rule-based approach to classify emotions in tweets.

2. **Machine Learning (Random Forest) Classifier:** Utilizes a Random Forest classifier for emotion classification. It will be tested both with and without the inclusion of Part-of-Speech (POS) tags.

3. **Transformer Model (DistilBERT):** Employs a state-of-the-art transformer model, DistilBERT, for emotion classification.

### Purpose
The primary aim of this project is to explore and compare the effectiveness of different approaches to emotion classification in tweets. By leveraging rule-based, traditional machine learning, and transformer-based techniques, we aim to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each method and identify which performs best for this specific task.

### Key Features
- Rule-based emotion classification for quick and simple analysis.
- Machine learning-based classification with Random Forest, offering insights into traditional methods.
- Transformer-based model using DistilBERT for cutting-edge deep learning.

### Getting Started
To replicate the experiments and explore the results, follow the instructions provided in the project's documentation. You will find details on dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation.

### Results
Our findings, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, will be presented in the project's documentation. This will help users understand the comparative performance of each model and make informed decisions for their own applications.
